# TheRedSquareHatesToBeOnline
You are a red square, called Redsquare and you hate your life (womans fault obviously).
Therefor you try to escape from a planet called online. 
You have to climb to a new world.
But you your brother green square hates you and enjoys seeing you get recjected from woman. 
So he sends the online police to catch you.
Yes the online police are pink triangles.
Why certainly!

AND No this story does not relate to me in any way, think about it, is our world called ONLINE????

# OMG I CANT MOVE? HOW SHOULD I ESCAPE ... IF I CANT MOVE!!!
Use the arrow keys "left" and "right", to move left and right.
Use the space bar to jump "up", dont use it to fall down.
Use the arrow key "down" to stop.

# For some kind of reason I was limited to 13k so no sounds here SORRY
Why? 
Cause why not ...
